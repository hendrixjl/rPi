This is my Raspberry Pi code repository. It is in constant flux for now. The main focus of the code 
is on controller a Rock Crawler (hendrixj.net).
I'm hoping to get this code where it can be built for Raspbian or Bare Metal.

manuever_program.cpp - This is the high-level routine to cause the crawler to
                       drive around.
                       
Special thanks to David Welch (https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi) and 
other folks on the forums at Raspberry PI (http://www.raspberrypi.org).
